## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation & Setup
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** None

#### Sub-steps:
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript configuration
- [x] Set up Supabase project and configure environment variables
- [x] Configure Clerk authentication with Google OAuth
- [x] Set up shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Create basic project structure and folder organization
- [x] Set up development environment with ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Configure database schema for users, videos, and channels
- [x] Set up YouTube API credentials and test connection
- [x] Initialize OpenAI API integration for chat functionality
- [x] Create basic landing page with URL input field

### Stage 2: Core Features
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stage 1 completion

#### Sub-steps:
- [x] Implement YouTube URL parsing and video ID extraction
- [x] Create YouTube API service for fetching video metadata
- [x] Build transcript downloading and caching system
- [x] Implement video player component with YouTube embed
- [x] Create chat interface with message history
- [x] Build vector search functionality for transcript chunks
- [x] Implement LLM chat responses with citations
- [x] Create split-screen layout for video and chat
- [x] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [x] Implement error handling for API failures
- [x] Create responsive design for mobile devices
- [x] Add basic user authentication flow
- [x] Dark mode first with toggle option for light mode
- [x] Sample questions should only show after we have a youtube link pasted
- [x] Click on sample question fills in the search box and auto searches
- [x] Start chatting should be disabled until we have a youtube link
- [x] Use Regex to validate youtube links
- [x] Ask your first question should be text input multiline

### Stage 3: Advanced Features
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stage 2 completion

#### Sub-steps
- [x] Save their chat and use anon_id for guest users
- [x] Limit how much they can chat in the same session as we are loading all in context
- [x] For signed in users we should have a way for them to see their history convert anon_id to user_id
- [x] Modify the UI to allow users to add channels and have a way to see their channels in the home page for signed in users
- [x] Implement channel URL processing which is getting all the urls in that channel and downloading the transcripts
- [x] Remove the option to type a question if they paste a channel url
- [x] Implement background job system for channel indexing
- [x] Build email notification system with Resend when the channel is indexed
- [x] Chron job to check if there are new videos in the channel and download the transcripts
- [x] Modify the UI to allow users select the channels they want to chat with for signed in users for now they can only chat with one channel as multi channel chat is comming soon so they can only index a channel.
- [x] Explore using openai assistant that allows you add files. Just have a file that contains all the video transcripts for all videos in a channel and let it do the RAG itself so instead of putting the whole video transcript in the context we can just put the file name and let the assistant do the RAG itself
- [x] Modify the UI to allow users to see the different videos the result is coming from. Just have a list of videos and citations on the left pane similar to what we already have.
- [x] Implement rate limiting and quota management
- [x] Create user dashboard for managing channels and history
- [x] Add comprehensive error tracking and logging
- [x] Implement caching strategies for improved performance
- [x] Surface a mini roadmap modal that shows “Coming soon: multi channel search, upload, enterprise” so you can brag without confusing.
- [x] Put a hard query cap per guest per day and show a progress ring on the chat button that counts down remaining queries. Counter pill uses accent background at ≥ 20 % and fades to warm amber under 20 %.
Progress ring animates around the Send button as credits burn. A tiny ⓘ icon next to the counter opens a popover with the full quota table.
- [x] FREE BETA Ask up to 30 questions per day and index 1 YouTube channel. Pro plans launch on August 5th. Early testers get 50% off for 2 months.
- [x] Implement analytics and user behavior tracking with posthog
- [x] Implement waitlist functionality with email notifications and position tracking
- [x] Create waitlist database table with auto-incrementing positions
- [x] Add toast notifications for waitlist actions
- [x] Show waitlist position instead of join button for existing members
- [x] Update roadmap with multimodal search and proper timeline
- [x] Fix badge hover states to use appropriate color variations
