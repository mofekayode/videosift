- Categorize by severity and component affected

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- Investigate underlying causes of issues
- Document findings and analysis process
- Identify patterns in recurring issues

### 3. Resolution Documentation
- Record all attempted solutions
- Document successful resolution steps
- Include code changes and configuration updates

### 4. Prevention Measures
- Identify ways to prevent similar issues
- Update development practices if needed
- Add relevant tests or validation

## Issue Categories

### Frontend Issues
- React component errors
- State management problems
- UI/UX rendering issues
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Build and deployment failures

### Backend Issues
- API endpoint failures
- Database connection problems
- Authentication/authorization errors
- External service integration issues
